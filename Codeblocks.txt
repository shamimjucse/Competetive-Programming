Codeblocks 17.12 installation with Contrib-Plugin on Ubuntu 16.04/17.04/18.04 ::

Due to various bugs in the codeblocks version 16 on Ubuntu 18.04,
it is recommended to use the latest version here.
Need to be installed by adding a ppa source:

Open terminal / press Ctrl+Alt+T and paste : 

* sudo add-apt-repository ppa:pasgui/ppa
* sudo apt-get update
* sudo apt-get install codeblocks
* sudo apt-get install codeblocks-contrib

If pc contains any existing codeblocks, remove it first.
* sudo apt remove codeblocks

If you face any problem to remove codeblocks dependency paste,
* sudo apt-get install -f
* dpkg --list | grep -i codeblocks
And remove all dependency manually by following command,
* sudo apt-get purge <dependency_name>
Last run this commannd,
* sudo apt autoremove

Now install codeblocks 17.12 again by following above command, 
it will work successfully.
